       " 'content': '<meta /><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\\n<p>The housing market plays a crucial role in the country\\'s economy. Currently, the government has managed to meet some of the housing market\\'s needs by constructing over 2.5 million residential units. According to the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development, the construction of four million homes is mandated under the national housing movement, with 2,518,000 units in various stages of construction.</p>\\n<p>In this context, Rouhollah Akbari, the special assistant to the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, stated in an interview that the national housing movement projects are progressing very well. He mentioned that 72,000 hectares of urban land and 50,000 hectares of rural land are being secured across the country. Of this, 37,700 hectares of urban land are in the design and implementation phase, and 24,000 hectares are under construction through individual, group, and mass building efforts. Additionally, renovation and modernization of 490,000 rural housing units have begun.</p>\\n<p>Akbari added that 6.5 million households in the country are renters. Housing has been provided for 1.8 million of these on government lands, with provisions made for the rest through self-owned lands and old urban textures.</p>\\n<p>As the moving season approaches, the government had taken various measures last year to manage this market, including a plan to organize the land, housing, and rental market, which was introduced in parliament last year and recently drafted by the Construction Commission in collaboration with the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development.</p>\\n<p>The implementation of this plan will address some of the rental market issues, facilitating the rental sector. It emphasizes strengthening the rental market through incentives for landlords, utilizing the capacity of municipalities to identify vacant homes, and using this sector\\'s tax revenue to revitalize old urban textures and build affordable housing for the needy. It also mandates all executive agencies to provide necessary information for free in the national real estate and housing system and includes executive guarantees for non-disclosure of information in the system and self-declaration in the national real estate and housing system.</p>\\n<p>Strengthening the national real estate and housing system to identify vacant homes, completing the national real estate and housing system, and recording transactions in the national real estate transactions system are other aspects addressed in this bill. Support for tenants through housing deposit loans and their increase due to inflation in the new year and monitoring the payment of these facilities by banks are other parts of this plan.</p>\\n<p>The plan for controlling and organizing residential property rents is quick and effective. Iqbal Shakari, a member of the Construction Commission of the Parliament, stated in an interview that the parliament has adopted two approaches to manage the housing market: a long-term approach to build one million residential units annually to compensate for housing shortages for el100  7542  100  7542    0     0   166k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  167kl Property Rents,\" which has been drafted and approved.</p>\\n<p>He emphasized that the plan to control and organize residential property rents is a short-term regulatory plan, the effects of which will soon be evident in the market. This plan has several new features that will remove the housing market from speculation and limit the influence of speculators, brokers, and dealers.</p>\\n<p>Payment of rents can be made through housing information platforms. He further mentioned that the plan separates real estate consultants\\' fees from housing prices, setting fees progressively to prevent conflicts of interest. People can also visit these offices and the document registration offices to register their contracts.</p>\\n<p>Information platforms are anticipated in the plan so that parties can register their contracts themselves without needing to visit the offices. These platforms are connected to the Ministry of Roads and the Judiciary\\'s real estate and housing system, allowing for complete and precisely timed rent payments.</p>\\n<p>Shakari noted that the platform allows for the evaluation of tenants and landlords, enabling them to rate each other, and this information will be visible in future contracts. Also, due to the precise evaluations performed by these platforms, the execution of related decrees is facilitated, and eviction orders are automatically issued. This also ensures that all contracts are standardized, marking a transformation in this area.</p>\\n<p>Hashemi, a housing policy expert, stated in an interview that the current implementation of the land and housing market regulation law is steering the rental housing market towards improvement and prosperity. According to this plan, all contracts, including rentals and sales, must be registered in the system with a tracking code to facilitate the assessment of the housing market situation. In provinces where the annual general inflation rate exceeds 30%, the Supreme Housing Council is required to determine the maximum rent increase cap and interest-free loans ranging from 50 to 100 percent of the annual general inflation.</p>\\n<p>Reducing transaction costs in the housing market and facilitating the buying and selling process are other features of this plan. The National Document and Property Registration Organization is required to provide online access for registration inquiries and the registration of any official document through the data exchange center for the real estate and housing system and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development\\'s real estate and property system within six months after this law becomes effective.</p>\\n<p>Another focus of this plan is the imposition of taxes on unused lands and how these taxes are spent. To reduce housing market speculation and prevent speculative transactions of units under construction until the residential unit is delivered or meters are installed and a completion certificate is issued, the transfer of national housing movement units in any form is prohibited. This emphasis is also highlighted in the plan.</p>\\n<p>Another important part of this plan is the ranking of real estate consultants based on customer satisfaction, which has been considered in this plan. This plan was approved several times in the parliament, sent to the Guardian Council for some amendments, returned to the parliament from the Guardian Council, and finally approved by the Guardian Council.</p>\\n'}"
